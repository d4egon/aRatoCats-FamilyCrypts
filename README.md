# aRatoCats-FamilyCrypts
A RimWorld Mod


Hello one and Hello all. Welcome to the next mod addition to RimWorld.

    FAMILY CRYPTS!
    
    The concept is simple enough. It's basically the mass grave mod with a twist. This time around you can upgrade and change the appearance of the grave.
    It can be a masoleum, a crypt, a monument or something else. Whatever the aRatoCat artists end up drawing.
    
    This is all brought to you by a solid team consisting of:
